  "Description": "Paul Hollywood's fruit rolls can be made ahead then heated up before adding a glossy glaze and citrus icing",
  "Author": "Paul Hollywood",
  "type": "Bread",
  "Ingredients": [
    "500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting",
    "7g sachet fast-action dried yeast",
    "300ml milk",
    "40g unsalted butter, softened at room temperature",
    "1 egg",
    "vegetable oil, for greasing",
    "25g unsalted butter, melted",
    "75g soft brown sugar",

    "100g chopped dried apricot",
    "50g caster sugar",
    "zest 1 lemon",
    "200g icing sugar"
  ],
  "Method": [
    "Put the flour and 1 tsp salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add the yeast. Meanwhile, warm the milk and butter in a pan until the butter melts and the mixture is lukewarm. Add the milk mixture and egg to the flour mixture and stir until the contents come together as a soft dough (add extra flour if you need to).",
    "Tip the dough onto a well-floured surface. Knead for 5 mins, adding more flour if necessary, until the dough is smooth, elastic and no longer sticky.",

    "For the filling, knock the dough back to its original size and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll it into a 1cm-thick rectangle. Brush all over with the melted butter, then sprinkle over the sugar, cinnamon and fruit.",
    "Roll up the dough into a tight cylinder, cut into 9 x 4cm slices and position on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between. Cover with a tea towel and set aside to rise for 30 mins.",
    "Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Bake the buns for 20-25 mins or until risen and golden brown. Meanwhile, melt the glaze sugar with 4 tbsp water until syrupy.",
